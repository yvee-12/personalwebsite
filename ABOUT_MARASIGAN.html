	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hii everyone!! I am Nynaeve Faye C. <br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Marasigan and I was born on July 11, <br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2007 so I'm currently 15 years old. <br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm on the 4th year of highschool <br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and attending a school called <br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gen.Pio del Pilar National HS. <br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My parents are Nicyl B. Corpuz <br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and Victorino Q. Marasigan Jr. <br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and I have 5 siblings. Nowadays, <br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I keep thinking that life is hard <br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but why do we keep on moving <br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on? I also don't have an idea <br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of what's the answer on that but<br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think someday the answer <br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will come to me by itself. <br>
